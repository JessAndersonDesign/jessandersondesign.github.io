					I'm Jess Anderson, a designer who likes to make things!
				</p>
				<p>
					My <a href="#portfolio">design experience</a> includes branding, marketing collateral, social media content creation, web design, packaging,
					layout, copywriting, and more. I am an experienced photo editor with product photography and styling skills as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to graphic design, I am a crafter by nature. I love making all kinds of things and have a soft spot for plush toys and paper crafts!
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm editing photos I enjoy listening to audio books, podcasts, or music. When I'm off the clock you'll find me doing yardwork or watching British televison.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks for getting to know me! <a href="#contact">Get in touch</a> if you have any questions or would 
					like to work together on a project.

			promotional products easy. I received many jpg files, some large and clear, some small
			and blurry. I always did my best to accurately recreate each customers logo needs into a
			finalized print ready vector format. Using Illustrator I would redraw each logo and then
			search for matching fonts to complete the designs.
